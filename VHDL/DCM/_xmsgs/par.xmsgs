<msg type="info" file="Par" num="282" delta="old" >No user timing constraints were detected or you have set the option to ignore timing constraints (&quot;par -x&quot;). Place and Route will run in &quot;Performance Evaluation Mode&quot; to automatically improve the performance of all internal clocks in this design. Because there are not defined timing requirements, a timing score will not be reported in the PAR report in this mode. The PAR timing summary will list the performance achieved for each clock. Note: For the fastest runtime, set the effort level to &quot;std&quot;.  For best performance, set the effort level to &quot;high&quot;.

<msg type="info" file="Place" num="834" delta="old" >Only a subset of IOs are locked. Out of <arg fmt="%d" index="1">30</arg> IOs, <arg fmt="%d" index="2">14</arg> are locked and <arg fmt="%d" index="3">16</arg> are not locked. <arg fmt="%s" index="4">If you would like to print the names of these IOs, please set the environment variable XIL_PAR_DESIGN_CHECK_VERBOSE to 1.</arg>

<msg type="warning" file="Place" num="1013" delta="old" >A clock IOB / DCM component pair have been found that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / DCM site pair.  The clock component &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">gest_disp/dcm_disp/DCM_SP_INST</arg>&gt; is placed at site &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="2">DCM_X0Y0</arg>&gt;.  The clock IO/DCM site can be paired if they are placed/locked in the same quadrant.  The IO component &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="3">clock</arg>&gt; is placed at site &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="4">P54</arg>&gt;.  This will not allow the use of the fast path between the IO and the Clock buffer. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="5">clock.PAD</arg>&gt; allowing your design to continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

<msg type="warning" file="Route" num="455" delta="old" >CLK Net:<arg fmt="%s" index="1">deb/result</arg> may have excessive skew because 
   <arg fmt="%d" index="2">1</arg> CLK pins and <arg fmt="%d" index="3">1</arg> NON_CLK pins failed to route using a CLK template.

<msg type="info" file="Timing" num="2761" delta="old" >N/A entries in the Constraints List may indicate that the constraint is not analyzed due to the following: No paths covered by this constraint; Other constraints intersect with this constraint; or This constraint was disabled by a Path Tracing Control. Please run the Timespec Interaction Report (TSI) via command line (trce tsi) or Timing Analyzer GUI.</msg>
