Simulator is doing circuit initialization process.
Finished circuit initialization process.
ERROR: at 80 ns(10000): Iteration limit 10000 is reached. Possible zero delay oscillation detected where simulation can not advance in time because signals can not resolve to a stable value in File "C:/Users/Michele/Documents/TesinaASE/VHDL/Davide/latch_flip-flop/rs_latch/nor_gate.vhd" Line 42. Please correct this code in order to advance past the current simulation time.

INFO: Simulator is stopped.
